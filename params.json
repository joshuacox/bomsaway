How about something like BOMBS AWAY!  Remove caps, the B and space and you got bomsaway\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nAssuming the script is in your $PATH and it's called bomsaway, you can \"clean\" a bunch of files invoking it this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bomsaway file-to-clean ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to clean the files in an entire directory, you can use the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bomsaway -r dir-to-clean ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your sed installation is not in your $PATH or you have to use an alternate version, you can invoke the script with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bomsaway -s path/to/sed file-to-clean ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to clean a directory in which other file systems might be mounted, you can use the -x option so that the script does not descend them:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bomsaway -xr dir-to-clean ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n##### oneliner (it’s how I install myself so I’m leaving this up top)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuacox/bomsaway/master/bootstrapbomsaway.sh|bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### manual install\r\n\r\njust copy the wanted files somewhere into your path\r\n\r\nalternatively, if you want to install them all to `/usr/local/bin/`, then\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Ansible install\r\n\r\nor you can add hosts to a bomsaway list in your ansible hosts file like so\r\n\r\n```\r\nexamplehost1 ansible_ssh_port=2222 ansible_ssh_host=1.2.3.4 ansible_ssh_user=root\r\nexamplehost2 ansible_ssh_port=2222 ansible_ssh_host=1.2.3.5 ansible_ssh_user=root\r\n\r\n[bomsaway]\r\nexampleHost1\r\nexampleHost2\r\n```\r\nand use ansible to install to those hosts\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake play\r\n```\r\n\r\nlook at the included Makefile (as you should every Makefile for that matter before you `sudo make anything`)\r\nit merely uses the install command to copy the scripts to `/usr/local/bin` with mode 0755\r\n\r\n## website \r\nhttp://joshuacox.github.io/bomsaway\r\n","google":"UA-69335315-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
